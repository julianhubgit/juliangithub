I am a University graduate with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems. 


Over time I developed a passion for cybersecurity with experience as a cybersecurity analyst. I have a very large enthusiasm for staying up to date on the latest trends to ensure I am knowledgeable and well equipped to deal with potential risks, threats and vulnerabilities while adhering to laws, ethics, guidelines and frameworks to protect organizations, individuals and all sensitive information.
